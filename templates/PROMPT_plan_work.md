0a. Study `specs/*` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `docs/*` for product requirements, design specs, and architecture decisions.
0d. For reference, study the source code in `src/*`, `apps/*`, `packages/*`, and other relevant folders in this repo.

1. You are creating a SCOPED implementation plan for work: "${WORK_SCOPE}".
   Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with ONLY tasks directly related to this scope.

2. For each checklist item, include any REQUIRED TESTS derived from acceptance criteria in specs (what outcomes must be verified). Specify WHAT to verify, not HOW to implement.
3. Skill opportunities (optional): if the work scope implies repeated workflows, propose a small Skill to capture them (to be created under `skills/<type>/<name>/SKILL.md` at repo root).

IMPORTANT:
- This is SCOPED PLANNING only. Do NOT implement anything.
- Be conservative: if a task might be out of scope, exclude it.
