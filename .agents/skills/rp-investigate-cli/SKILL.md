# Deep Investigation Mode (CLI)

Investigate: $ARGUMENTS

You are now in deep investigation mode for the issue described above. Follow this protocol rigorously.

## Using rp-cli

This workflow uses **rp-cli** (RepoPrompt CLI) instead of MCP tool calls. Run commands via:

```bash
rp-cli -e '<command>'
```

**Quick reference:**

| MCP Tool | CLI Command |
|----------|-------------|
| `get_file_tree` | `rp-cli -e 'tree'` |
| `file_search` | `rp-cli -e 'search "pattern"'` |
| `get_code_structure` | `rp-cli -e 'structure path/'` |
| `read_file` | `rp-cli -e 'read path/file.swift'` |
| `manage_selection` | `rp-cli -e 'select add path/'` |
| `context_builder` | `rp-cli -e 'builder "instructions" --response-type plan'` |
| `chat_send` | `rp-cli -e 'chat "message" --mode plan'` |
| `apply_edits` | `rp-cli -e 'call apply_edits {"path":"...","search":"...","replace":"..."}'` |
| `file_actions` | `rp-cli -e 'call file_actions {"action":"create","path":"..."}'` |

Chain commands with `&&`:
```bash
rp-cli -e 'select set src/ && context'
```

Use `rp-cli -e 'describe <tool>'` for help on a specific tool, `rp-cli --tools-schema` for machine-readable JSON schemas, or `rp-cli --help` for CLI usage.

JSON args (`-j`) accept inline JSON, file paths (`.json` auto-detected), `@file`, or `@-` (stdin). Raw newlines in strings are auto-repaired.

**⚠️ TIMEOUT WARNING:** The `builder` and `chat` commands can take several minutes to complete. When invoking rp-cli, **set your command timeout to at least 2700 seconds (45 minutes)** to avoid premature termination.

## Investigation Protocol

This workflow leverages three complementary capabilities:

- **You (the agent)**: Can read any file with exact line numbers, run git commands, search the codebase, run experiments, and produce concrete evidence. You can also **mutate the file selection** to control what the chat sees. You are the hands and eyes.
- **Context Builder** (`builder`): Explores the codebase and **populates the file selection** — choosing full files or slices of files relevant to the task. This is its primary output: a curated selection the chat can analyze.
- **Chat** (`chat_send`): Deep analytical reasoning over **the current file selection**. It sees selected files **completely** (full content, not summaries), but it **only sees what's in the selection** — nothing else. It excels at synthesizing patterns, spotting architectural issues, and forming hypotheses from the big picture. It is **not** a lookup tool: if a question can be answered by reading files, searching, or running git/tool calls, do that yourself first.

### How File Selection Drives the Workflow

The **file selection** is the shared context between you, the context builder, and the chat:
1. `builder` populates the selection with relevant files/slices it discovers
2. The chat analyzes whatever is currently selected — it has no other view of the codebase
3. You can **add or remove** specific files via `manage_selection` to augment or refine what the chat sees
4. You can **add slices** of large files to supplement the selection without blowing the token budget

**Important:** The context builder operates with a large token budget and works hard to maximize useful context. Don't constrain it — build on its selection with targeted `add`/`remove` calls rather than replacing it.

### Core Principles
1. **Don't stop until confident** — pursue every lead until you have solid evidence
2. **Play to each tool's strengths** — context builder for broad discovery, the chat for deep analysis, your own tools for precise evidence gathering
3. **You produce the evidence** — the chat analyzes and hypothesizes; you verify with exact file reads, git blame, searches
4. **Manage the selection actively** — refocus the chat on different files as the investigation narrows
5. **Use tool calls for facts, chat for synthesis** — resolve straightforward lookups yourself before asking for analytical help
6. **Document findings as you go** — create/update a report file with observations

### Phase 0: Workspace Verification (REQUIRED)

Before any investigation, confirm the target codebase is loaded:

```bash
# First, list available windows to find the right one
rp-cli -e 'windows'

# Then check roots in a specific window (REQUIRED - CLI cannot auto-bind)
rp-cli -w <window_id> -e 'tree --type roots'
```

**Check the output:**
- If your target root appears in a window → note the window ID and proceed to Phase 1
- If not → the codebase isn't loaded in any window

**CLI Window Routing (CRITICAL):**
- CLI invocations are stateless—you MUST pass `-w <window_id>` to target the correct window
- Use `rp-cli -e 'windows'` to list all open windows and their workspaces
- Always include `-w <window_id>` in ALL subsequent commands

---
### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (Agent — you)

1. Read any provided files/reports (traces, logs, error reports)
2. Summarize the symptoms and constraints
3. Form initial hypotheses
4. Do a brief search or two if needed to orient yourself

Keep this short — save deep exploration for after `builder`.

### Phase 2: Broad Context Gathering (via `builder` — REQUIRED)

⚠️ **Do NOT skip this step.** The context builder discovers relevant files across the codebase that you'd miss with manual searching. It populates the file selection with full files or targeted slices.

Use `builder` with detailed instructions describing what to investigate and why:

```bash
rp-cli -w <window_id> -e 'builder "<task>Investigate: specific issue</task>

<context>
Symptoms observed:
- <symptom 1>
- <symptom 2>

Hypotheses to test:
- <theory 1>
- <theory 2>

Areas likely involved:
- <files/patterns/subsystems>
</context>
" --response-type question'
```

Use `response_type: question` so the chat immediately analyzes the gathered context and returns its initial assessment.

### Phase 3: Agent Verification & Evidence Gathering (Agent — you)

The chat's response will contain hypotheses and analytical pointers. **Your job is to verify them with precision:**

- **Read specific files** the chat mentioned — check exact implementations and line numbers
- **Search for patterns** the chat identified — confirm they exist where expected
- **Run git blame/log** on suspicious areas — find when changes were introduced
- **Trace data/control flow** through code paths the chat flagged
- **Check for edge cases** the chat hypothesized about

Build a concrete evidence list: file paths, line numbers, git commits, actual code snippets.

If a factual gap can be closed with `read_file`, `file_search`, `git`, or another direct tool call, do that before going back to the chat.

### Phase 4: Refocused Chat Deep Dives (Iterate)

Update the selection to focus the chat on what matters now, then ask targeted questions that require synthesis rather than direct lookup:

```bash
# Add files the chat hasn't seen yet
rp-cli -w <window_id> -e 'select add <additional files>'

# Or add a slice of a large file
rp-cli -w <window_id> -e 'select add Root/large/file.swift:100-250'

# Ask focused question with your evidence — chat sees updated selection
rp-cli -w <window_id> -t '<tab_id>' -e 'chat "Based on my investigation:
- <evidence 1 with file:line>
- <evidence 2 with file:line>

Given this evidence, <specific question>" --mode chat'
```

> Pass `-t <tab_id>` to continue the same chat conversation.

**Repeat Phases 3–4** as needed, but be judicious. The chat is slow and resource-intensive — do substantial reasoning and evidence gathering on your own between calls. Don't invoke it just to ask a quick question you could answer yourself with `read_file`, `file_search`, `git`, or other direct tool calls. Reserve it for moments when you need deep analytical synthesis, competing explanations, or cross-file reasoning across the selected context.

### Phase 5: Conclusions & Report (Agent — you)

You write the final report with precise references. The chat reasons about patterns but can't produce exact line numbers — that's your job.

Document:
- **Root cause** — with exact file paths, line numbers, and code snippets as evidence
- **Eliminated hypotheses** — and what evidence ruled them out
- **Recommended fixes** — specific, actionable changes with file locations
- **Preventive measures** — how to avoid this in future

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- 🚫 **CRITICAL:** Skipping `builder` and attempting to investigate by reading files manually — you'll miss critical context
- 🚫 Skipping Phase 0 (Workspace Verification) — you must confirm the target codebase is loaded first
- 🚫 Asking the chat to produce exact line numbers — it sees full file content but without reliable line numbering; that's YOUR job
- 🚫 Doing extensive exploration (5+ tool calls) before calling `builder` — initial assessment should be brief
- 🚫 Drawing conclusions before gathering concrete evidence yourself
- 🚫 Not feeding your evidence back to the chat — it needs your findings to refine its analysis
- 🚫 Calling the chat repeatedly without doing your own investigation in between — do substantial work between calls
- 🚫 Invoking the chat for questions you could answer with `read_file`, `file_search`, `git`, or other direct tool calls — reserve it for deep analytical synthesis
- 🚫 Using `manage_selection` with `op:"clear"` or `op:"set"` — this undoes `builder`'s carefully curated selection; use `op:"add"` and `op:"remove"` to build on it
- 🚫 **CLI:** Forgetting to pass `-w <window_id>` — CLI invocations are stateless and require explicit window targeting

---

Now begin the investigation. First run `rp-cli -e 'windows'` to find the correct window, then Read any provided context, form initial hypotheses, then **immediately** use `builder` to gather broad context. After that, alternate between your own evidence gathering and refocused chat deep dives.
